                        “What’s the meaning of life?” is a cliche philosophical
                        question, but it touches on something fundamental about
                        how humans relate to the world around them. People want
                        to know that there’s significance to their lives, but
                        not necessarily in any grandiose sense. Most of us just
                        want to feel that there’s value in getting up and being
                        active each day. We search for signs that our existence
                        is a net good in the world, even if only on a minuscule
                        scale in the grander scheme of the universe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the past, researchers have identified <a
                            href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30614732/"
                            >three important constructs</a
                        > underlying “meaning in life”. The first is <em
                            >coherence</em
                        >, which refers to an ability to make sense of what’s
                        happening in our lives as we build a personal story. The
                        second is <em>purpose</em>, which is the feeling that
                        we’re working toward important life goals. The third is <em
                            >mattering</em
                        >, which is the belief that our lives matter in the
                        wider context of the world around us.

                    <p>
                        However, new evidence is revealing an overlooked
                        construct, and it may be the most crucial one of all.
                        Researchers are calling it “experiential appreciation”,
                        and it refers to enjoying and appreciating sensations as
                        you experience them — a concept that you may already
                        recognize if you’re familiar with mindfulness.

                        The fourth construct of meaning in life
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In a <a
                            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01283-6.pdf"
                            >recently published paper</a
                        > (February 2022), researchers probed what it means to experience
                        meaning in life. In their first study, they analyzed past
                        survey data from over 11,000 people across 30 countries.
                        These surveys were originally designed to assess coping strategies
                        during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the researchers plucked
                        out individual questions linked to meaning-in-life constructs.
                        Here’s an example for each construct; participants had to
                        rate their agreement with each statement or question below:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Coherence: “I’ve been looking for something good in
                            what is happening”
                        </li>
                        <li>Purpose: “I do something productive every day”</li>
                        <li>
                            Mattering: “I’m doing what is good for our society”
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Experiential appreciation: “I appreciate my life as
                            it is right now regardless of the circumstances”
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Meaning in life: “In general, to what extent do you
                            feel that what you do in your life is valuable and
                            worthwhile?”
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The researchers analyzed the survey data, testing how
                        each construct predicted people’s scores in the overall
                        meaning-in-life measure. Consistent with previous
                        research, the three traditional constructs (coherence,
                        purpose, and mattering) all individually predicted
                        meaning in life to some extent. The interesting part was
                        that after accounting for those three constructs, the
                        new fourth construct of experiential appreciation
                        explained another significant portion of people’s
                        meaning in life. In other words, a major ingredient in
                        the meaning-in-life formula had been missed by previous
                        researchers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a second study, the researchers developed their own
                        way to measure experiential appreciation. For the three
                        older constructs, they pulled specialized survey
                        questions from previously published studies. But since
                        experiential appreciation was a newcomer, they had to
                        formalize its meaning and how to measure it. After some
                        careful analysis, they ended up with five survey items.
                        Anyone who scores highly on these items is high in
                        experiential appreciation:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            “I have great appreciation for the beauty of life.”
                        </li>
                        <li>“I take great interest in my daily activities.”</li>
                        <li>“I appreciate a wide variety of experiences.”</li>
                        <li>“I appreciate the little things in life.”</li>
                        <li>
                            “I tend to find myself deeply engaged in
                            conversations with other people.”
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Using these new measures together with the standard
                        measures for the other three constructs, the researchers
                        sent surveys to over 1500 people in the US and China.
                        Instead of relying on indirect questions as they did in
                        the previous COVID survey analysis, they collected
                        dedicated data using well-tested measures for each
                        construct.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="bulletted-list">Bulletted List</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consistently predicted</li>
                        <li>Coherence was a little</li>

                    <p>
                        Once again, higher purpose, higher mattering, and higher
                        experiential appreciation all consistently predicted
                        higher meaning in life. The effects of coherence were a
                        little weaker, showing significant predictive power in
                        the Chinese sample but not the American sample. While
                        coherence was a little shaky, experiential appreciation
                        certainly wasn’t.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So at least when <strong>analyzing</strong> the connections
                        between all of these <em>concepts</em>, experiential
                        appreciation wins a deserving place in the fight for
                        meaning in life. But could you actually boost meaning in
                        life by boosting experiential appreciation?

                    <p>
                        To answer this, the researchers came up with a way to
                        stimulate people’s experiential appreciation: they
                        showed everyone an awe-inspiring 2-min video from the
                        nature documentary, “Planet Earth”. Few things in life
                        give us a deeper connection to the present moment than
                        sights of hypnotic oceans, lush forests, and David
                        Attenborough documentaries.

                        The nature manipulation worked. Following the video,
                        people reported higher levels of experiential
                        appreciation. More importantly, by boosting their
                        experiential appreciation, the video also indirectly
                        raised how much people reported feeling a sense of
                        meaning in their life. The researchers now had evidence
                        of a causal connection between appreciating the moment
                        and feeling that life is valuable.

                            > Here’s a simple wheel I’ve made to visualize the four
                            elements associated with meaning in life according to
                            the latest evidence. Think about how each of them applies
                            to your own life. Feelings like “meaning in life” are
                            incredibly subjective, but model-based thinking makes
                            them less abstract and more practical. At difficult moments,
                            work out where your problems might lie on this wheel.

                            studies above show that experiential awareness is an
                            important component of meaning in life. Here are two
                            ways to practice it in your own life:

                            <strong><em>Spend time in nature</em>:</strong> Whether
                            it’s a short walk through your local park or a bigger
                            trip out into the wilderness, make regular time for interacting
                            with nature. And when you can’t get out of the house,
                            nature documentaries are a great fallback! Although the
                            mechanisms are still unclear, there are several ways
                            nature might benefit emotional wellbeing. For example,
                            observing nature’s breathtaking beauty is like visiting
                            the best art gallery on Earth. There’s a reason so many
                            paintings represent natural scenes and landscapes. Since
                            we evolved in the natural world, our psychology reacts
                            to it in a profoundly positive way. Nature’s immensity
                            also makes you feel connected to something bigger outside
                            yourself. When you’re immersed in nature, you realize
                            the grand world that you’re a part of. This puts some
                            of your smaller daily problems into perspective. Finally,
                            in nature, you’re exposed to calm and natural sensory
                            stimulation. For city dwellers, this is a refreshing
                            experience because the sensory stimulation you experience
                            in a city is hectic and exhausting. Glaring ads grab
                            your attention from the left, a pushy pedestrian grabs
                            your attention from the right, and car horns grab your
                            attention from everywhere else. Nature allows you to
                            be more voluntary and relaxed about how your attention
                            is drifting

                            appreciation is all about living in the moment and focusing
                            your attention on enjoying sensations as they happen.
                            You can practice this ability with mindfulness techniques.

                            great quote from the piece: “The real meditation practice
                            is the 24 hours itself — it’s life itself. It’s not sitting
                            on a cushion in the cross-legged posture or lying in
                            a yoga pose called the corpse pose or anything like that…
                            we’re cultivating <em>that</em> so that we get more comfortable
                            with living out <em>all</em> our moments as if they really
                            mattered and therefore being there for them — the good
                            ones, the bad ones, the ugly ones, the stressful ones,
                            the difficult ones, the painful ones.”
